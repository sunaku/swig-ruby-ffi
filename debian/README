The Debian Package swig1.3
--------------------------

This is SWIG 1.3 (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)
packaged for Debian GNU/Linux.

SWIG 1.3 is not fully compatible with SWIG 1.1. It is a re-development
effort of SWIG 1.1 (which was written in C++) in ANSI C.  The 1.3
series is in "alpha" state.  Release 1.3a5 was rather stable, and it
should be used for new projects rather than the ancient release
1.1p5.  See the file `NEW' for information on the new features of the
1.3 series.

This Debian package derives from the release 1.3a5 and corresponds to
the "mkoeppe-1-3-a5-patches" branch of the SWIG CVS repository.  It
fixes several bugs and enhances several language backends.  See the
top of the file `CHANGES' for details.
