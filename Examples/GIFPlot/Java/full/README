This example runs the entire gifplot.h header file through SWIG without
any changes.  The program 'runme.java' does something a little more 
interesting. After doing a make, run it using 'java runme'. You'll have to go 
look at the header file to get a complete listing of the functions.

Note the differences in the runme.java files between this example and the  
'full' example. This example does not use shadow classes.
